## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS / SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) - For animation styles

### What I learned

This challenge was perfect to test the `clamp` property that I saw for `font-size`. This is great to adapt the text according to the screen size. Below you can see how I implemented `clamp`: 

```scss
.testimonial__quote {
  font: 300 clamp(1.125rem, 2.3vw, 2rem)/1.5rem $f-family;
}
```
You can see how I included this one inside the `font` shorthand. `clamp` will take 3 values: min, default and max. So depending on the screen size the text won't be less than `1.125rem` nor higher than `2rem`, but can vary `2.3vw` and that is why the text can change dynamically its `font-size`.

### Continued development

This was an interesting challenge to implement the slider feature which I have not done before. I will continue looking for ways to do it better and learn how to create a functionality to move the slides by dragging them with the mouse.

### Useful resources

- [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) - This helped me when I was looking for some way of animate my slider every time the user clicked the slider buttons, this library can implement those animations easy and with no additional effort.
